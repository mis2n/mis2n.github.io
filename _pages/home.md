### Welcome!

Hello! I am an AI and Machine Learning researcher with a background in physics and astronomy. My research focuses on interdisciplinary 
applications of AI and ML. Specifically, my work bridges the gap between state-of-the-art technologies and ancient literary texts 
utilizing technologies including Handwritten Text Recognition, Natural Language Processing, and statistical analysis. My work primarily 
focuses on the field of papyrology, but is broadly applicable to computer vision and language modeling research. Thanks for visiting!

### About my work

I am the proud creator of the AL-PUB dataset, a large-scale, crowdsourced image dataset containing Greek characters on ancient papyri. This dataset is available on Kaggle and has been used in several deep learning based research projects. Other research projects include blockchain and smart contracts for digital edition management, as well as transfer learning and generative AI. I am also interested in the application of AI and Machine Learning to other fields such as physics, chemistry, and astronomy. Additional interests include quantum computing & HPC clusters. Please check out AL-PUB, my computational projects, and social media pages at the links on the right.
