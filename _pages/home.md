### Welcome!

Hello, and welcome to my page! I am a postdoctoral apointee at Argonne National Laboratory working at the intersection of advanced technology and nuclear forensics. My work is focused on integrating AI/ML and AR/VR technologies into forensic workflows to improve training, safety, and efficiency for radiological work. I also work on a wide array of projects in several disciplines including radiochemistry, cyber security, detector technologies, autonomous discovery, software development, and various AI projects. I am a computational scientist and AI/ML researcher with a background in physics and astronomy. My previous research focus has been interdisciplinary applications of AI and ML, bridging the gap between state-of-the-art technologies and the study of ancient literary texts utilizing technologies such as Handwritten Text Recognition, Natural Language Processing, and statistical analysis. This work primarily focused on the field of papyrology, but is broadly applicable to computer vision and language modeling research.

### About my research

I am the proud creator of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miswindall/al-pub-v2">AL-PUBv2</a> dataset, a large-scale, crowdsourced image dataset containing Greek characters on ancient papyrus. This dataset is available on Kaggle and has been used in several deep learning research projects. Additional research projects include blockchain and smart contracts for digital edition management, as well as transfer learning and generative AI. I am also interested in the application of AI and Machine Learning to other fields such as physics, chemistry, and astronomy. Other interests include quantum computing & HPC clusters.
