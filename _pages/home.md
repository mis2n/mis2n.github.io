### Welcome!

Hello! I am a computational scientist and AI/ML researcher with a background in physics and astronomy. My research focus has been interdisciplinary 
applications of AI and ML, bridges the gap between state-of-the-art technologies and the study of ancient literary texts 
utilizing technologies such as Handwritten Text Recognition, Natural Language Processing, and statistical analysis. My work primarily 
focuses on the field of papyrology, but is broadly applicable to computer vision and language modeling research. I have recently 
begun a postdoctoral apointment with Argonne National Laboratory, developing AR/VR software for nuclear forensics. Thanks for visiting!

### About my research

I am the proud creator of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miswindall/al-pub-v2">AL-PUBv2</a> dataset, a large-scale, crowdsourced image dataset containing Greek characters on ancient papyrus. This dataset is available on Kaggle and has been used in several deep learning research projects. Additional research projects include blockchain and smart contracts for digital edition management, as well as transfer learning and generative AI. I am also interested in the application of AI and Machine Learning to other fields such as physics, chemistry, and astronomy. Other interests include quantum computing & HPC clusters.
