  headline: "I'm happy to share that my dataset AL_PUB is now available on Kaggle! AL_PUB is a large scale image dataset for AI/ML use cases. Each image is an ancient Greek character on papyrus. The dataset was created using crowdsourced annotations from the Ancient Lives Project, of over 12,000 papyrus fragment images. Each fragment is from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri collection. It has only been on Kaggle for a few days and someone has already trained a vision transformer on the data. Please check it out if you're interested! https://lnkd.in/gWGzyBz7"
